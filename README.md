# 1D-Pong
The aim of this project is to develop a 1D-Pong-Game using a microcontoller as the heart of the system.

## Requirements ##
- [ ] Solder Iron
- [x] Cable/ Jumper
- [x] Microcontroller
- [ ] Led Strip/ LED with a shift-reg
- [x] 2x Buttons
- [x] 1x Buzzer
- [x] Seven-Segmetn-Dispaly

## Spec ##
### Musts ###
The System consists of a microcontroller as the main processor and controller of the peripherials.

An LED strip which displays the playing field.
  -Red:     Point zone
  -Yellow:  Hit zone
  -Green:   Free zone
  
Two buttons, one for each player. The player has to press the button when the "ball" reaches the hit zone, in order to send the ball back to their opponent.

A seven-segment display showing the current score.

### Shoulds ###
There should be a buzzer highlighting events like the starting of the game, hitting of the ball, scoring and winning.


### Nice-to-haves ###
It would be nice if the system was semi-portable e.g. a computer isn't needed but only an AC supply.
Also an I/O switch for turning the whole system on and off.
